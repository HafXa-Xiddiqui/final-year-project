# final-year-project
DESCRIPTION:

In today's context, industrial robots play a vital role in curbing resource wastage and accomplishing tasks with unparalleled precision. Furthermore, in hazardous environments, human labor poses a threat to life.
Therefore, we dedicated our project to developing an autonomous industrial robot to optimize productivity and ensure safety.

Tools used in this project:

Hardware Tools: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, RC transmitter, sensors and actuators to maneuver the robot.

Software Tools: SolidWorks, Ansys, ROS Framework, Moveit motion planning framework.
